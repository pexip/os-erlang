Improve documentation.

Fix all fixme's :-)

Makefiles and configure tests
	Can always be improved, especially mine.

Port programs instead of drivers.
	Another backend which doesn't crash the emulator during 
	developing/testing or at customer site,
	Option to wx:new().

Cleanup the code!!!!

Platform specific classes/functions
	wxPrinterDC for example is mac and windows only.

Add user_data now that erl_driver can unpack term_binaries.

Add missing clases, especially the ones used in the api: 
   wxDropTarget wxXmlResourceHandler wxGLContext 

Testing and debugging.

API stuff: (Stuff I've or others have seen that I don't have time to fix right now)
